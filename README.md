# Algorithms
Hi, I am trying to solve problems with algorithms.
these are questions that I found a solution to them. Time Complexity and Space Complexity are important.																																						
1- Find overlapping : 
  Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
  Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
  Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6]
